            <p class="history_p">In 1981, Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute published his
                account of a functional
                rapid-prototyping system using photopolymers (more on those in a minute). A solid, printed model was
                built up in layers,
                each of which corresponded to a cross-sectional slice in the model. Sound familiar?

                Three years later, in 1984, Charles Hull made 3D-printing history by inventing stereolithography.
                Stereolithography lets
                designers create 3D models using digital data, which can then be used to create a tangible object.

                The key to stereolithography is a kind of acrylic-based material known as photopolymer. Hit a vat of
                liquid photopolymer
                with a UV laser beam, and the light-exposed portion will instantly turn into solid piece of plastic,
                molded into the
                shape of your 3D-model design. Needless to say, this new technology was big news to inventors, who could
                now
                theoretically prototype and test their designs without having to make a huge upfront investment in
                manufacturing.<a href="https://www.autodesk.com/redshift/history-of-3d-printing/" target="_blank">More about 3d printing history.</a></p>

                <li class="list_numbers">
                    <p>SLA is a fast prototyping process. Those who use this technology are serious about accuracy and
                        precision. It can
                        produce objects from 3D CAD data (computer-generated) files in just a few hours. This is a 3D
                        printing process that’s
                        popular for its fine details and exactness. Machines that use this technology produce unique
                        models, patterns,
                        prototypes, and various production parts. They do this by converting liquid photopolymers (a
                        special type of plastic)
                        into solid 3D objects, one layer at a time. The plastic is first heated to turn it into a
                        semi-liquid form, and then it
                        hardens on contact. The printer constructs each of these layers using an ultra violet laser,
                        directed by X and Y
                        scanning mirrors. Just before each print cycle, a recoater blade moves across the surface to
                        ensure each thin layer of
                        resin spreads evenly across the object. The print cycle continues in this way, building 3D
                        objects from the bottom up.</p>

                <h2 class="titles">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Technology</h2>
                <li class="list_numbers">
                    <p>FDM is a 3D printing process developed by Scott Crump, and then implemented by Stratasys Ltd., in
                        the 1980s. It uses
                        production grade thermal plastic materials to print its 3D objects. It’s popular for producing
                        functional prototypes,
                        concept models, and manufacturing aids. It’s a technology that can create accurate details and
                        boasts an exceptional
                        strength to weight ratio.

                        Before the FDM printing process begins, the user has to slice the 3D CAD data (the 3D model)
                        into multiple layers using
                        special software. The sliced CAD data goes to the printer which then builds the object layer at
                        a time on the build
                        platform. It does this simply by heating and then extruding the thermoplastic filament through
                        the nozzle and onto the
                        base. The printer can also extrude various support materials as well as the thermoplastic. For
                        example, as a way to
                        support upper layers, the printer can add special support material underneath, which then
                        dissolves after the printing
                        process. As with all 3D printers, the time it takes to print all depends on the objects size and
                        its complexity.</p>

                <img class="list_images" src="images\SLS_image.jpg" alt="SLS 3d printing">
                <h2 class="titles">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) Technology</h2>
                <li class="list_numbers">

                    <p>The laser sinters powdered metal materials (though it can utilize other materials too, like white
                        nylon powder, ceramics
                        and even glass). Here’s how it works:

                        The build platform, or bed, lowers incrementally with each successive laser scan. It’s a process
                        that repeats one layer
                        at a time until it reaches the object’s height. There is un-sintered support from other powders
                        during the build process
                        that surround and protect the model. This means the 3D objects don’t need other support
                        structures during the build.
                        Someone will remove the un-sintered powders manually after printing. SLS produces durable, high
                        precision parts, and it
                        can use a wide range of materials. It’s a perfect technology for fully-functional, end-use parts
                        and prototypes. SLS is
                        quite similar to SLA technology with regards to speed and quality. The main difference is with
                        the materials, as SLS
                        uses powdered substances, whereas SLA uses liquid resins. It’s this wide variety of available
                        materials that makes SLA
                        technology so popular for printing customized objects.</p>

                <h2 class="titles">Electron Beam Melting (EBM) Technology</h2>
                <li class="list_numbers">

                    <p>A Swedish company called Arcam AB founded EBM® in 1997. This is a 3D printing technology similar
                        to SLM (see above), in
                        that it uses a powder bed fusion technique. The difference between the two is the power source.
                        The SLM approach above
                        uses high-powered laser in a chamber of noble, or inert gas. EBM, on the other hand, uses a
                        powerful electron beam in a
                        vacuum. Aside from the power source, the remaining processes between the two are quite similar.
                        EBM’s main use is to 3D
                        print metal parts. Its main characteristics are its ability to achieve complex geometries with
                        freedom of design. EBM
                        also produces parts that are incredibly strong and dense in their makeup.</p>
